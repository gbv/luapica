- more LuaDoc
- agree on API to access fields and subfields
- add small conversion examples (probably with a 'main' function)
- publish as Lua Rock (see http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks/)
- maybe switch to another testing framework like http://fperrad.github.com/lua-TestMore/
  or http://luaforge.net/projects/lunit/ instead of luaunit
- enchance pattern filters with http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html 
- add to luarocks and luadist?
